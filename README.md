# MessingAroundwithCpp
This is something that I made using classes and pointers in cpp which basically defines a class which stores an integer value through a function. Through another function it creates another object of its own type dynamically using the keyword new. 

The address of this new object is then stored in itself through which the next object's value can be set or can be accessed to create further objects. In short the object points to an object that it has created and that object does the same. 

I think this is some sort of a link list but I'm a bit unsure as I have not seen it to be implemented like this.
